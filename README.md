# my-first-agent
This project is an intelligent, multi-agent system built using LangGraph and LLMs to automate business insights and marketing workflows. It takes structured or unstructured user input (like reviews and sales data), analyzes it through a chain of collaborative agents, and generates actionable outputs such as emails, marketing ideas, and summaries.
